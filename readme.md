# Voot – LLM-powered Live Translation for HarmonyOS

Voot, standing for "**Vo**ice **O**n **T**op," is an intelligent simultaneous-interpretation & text translation app for **HarmonyOS**, powered by **your own LLM / translation APIs**.  
It is designed with three core principles: **security, privacy, and simplicity**.

> [!NOTE]
> Voot does not provide or resell any LLM/translation service.  
> You bring your own API keys (OpenAI, DeepL, Ollama, 豆包, etc.).

## Features

- 🔐 **Secure by design**
  - No built-in or hosted model – you must configure your own API keys.
  - API keys are stored **only in the HarmonyOS sandbox**, protected by **face / biometric unlock**.
  - No third-party analytics SDKs.

- 🕵️ **Privacy-first**
  - Audio is processed **locally** on-device for capture & pre-processing.
  - Recorded audio for translation is **not uploaded** and is **destroyed after processing**.
  - Only the minimal text required for translation is sent directly to the provider you configure.

- 🧩 **Multi-provider support**
  - OpenAI (GPT-style chat / translation)
  - DeepL
  - Ollama (local LLM gateway)
  - 豆包 / other custom endpoints (via configurable URL & API key)

- 🗣️ **Simultaneous interpretation**
  - One-tap start/stop of “live” translation.
  - Clear split between **original text** and **translated text**.

- 🌐 **Flexible language configuration**
  - Global “target language” selector.
  - Per-API configuration (prompt, system instructions, etc.).
- 📚 **Glossary / Terminology Support**
  - Define custom term pairs (e.g., `HarmonyOS=鸿蒙`) to force specific translations.
  - Injected directly into the LLM system prompt for high adherence.

- 🔄 **Device Continuation (流转)**
  - Seamlessly transfer your active translation session to another HarmonyOS device (e.g., from Phone to Tablet).
  - Keeps your current transcription and translation context intact.

- 📂 **History & Favorites**
  - Automatically saves your translation sessions locally.
  - Review past conversations and star ⭐ important ones for quick access.
- 🎛️ **Token Usage Analytics**
  - Track your API usage and costs in real-time.
  - Visual charts for daily/weekly consumption.
  - Desktop widgets to monitor usage at a glance.

- 🖼️ **Picture-in-Picture (PiP) Subtitles**
  - Floating subtitle window that works over other apps.
  - Resizable and movable overlay for seamless multitasking.

- 📱 **Desktop Widgets**
  - **Control Card**: Start/stop subtitle and interpretation directly from the home screen.
  - **Token Card**: Monitor your API token usage without opening the app.

- 💡 **Simple UI, ArkTS only**
  - Frontend written purely in **ArkTS**, no extra UI framework.
  - Minimalist layout: buttons, text, and light effects – optimized for real-time usage.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* HarmonyOS toolchain:

  * DevEco Studio with ArkTS support
  * HarmonyOS SDK (version matching the project)
* A HarmonyOS device or emulator
* One or more API keys, for example:

  * OpenAI API key
  * DeepL API key
  * Ollama endpoint running locally or on LAN
  * 豆包 / other compatible HTTP API

### Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YANGZX22/Voot.git
cd Voot
```

Open the project in [**DevEco Studio**](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/deveco-studio/).

### Run

1. Connect a HarmonyOS device or start an emulator.
2. In DevEco Studio, select the run configuration corresponding to the app.
3. Click **Run** to build and deploy.


## Install Hap

Or you can use [Auto-installer](https://github.com/likuai2010/auto-installer/) or [DevEcho Testing](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/deveco-testing/) for installation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Huawei's signing servers block IP addresses outside mainland China. To sideload software for HarmonyOS NEXT in countries/regions outside mainland China.

> [!NOTE]
> Apps sideloaded via self-signing on HarmonyOS NEXT have a default validity period of 14 days. Completing [Developer Real-Name Authentication](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/verified/enrollment) extends this period to 180 days.


## Configuration

### API Providers

In the **“配置 API / Configure API”** tab:
1. Choose the current provider (e.g. OpenAI, DeepL, Ollama, 豆包).
2. Tap **“配置 API / Configure API”**.
3. For each provider, fill in:

   * **API URL** (e.g. `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`,
     `https://api-free.deepl.com/v2/translate`, or your Ollama endpoint)
   * **API Key / Token**
   * Optional: custom **prompt / system message** used for translation.

The configuration is stored **locally** in the sandbox and bound to face / biometric verification when accessing/modifying.

### Target Languages

In the **“目标语言 / Target language”** section:

1. Select your default output language (e.g. 中文, English, etc.).
2. The chosen target language is used for all translation APIs by default.

### Glossary / Terminology

In the **“术语库 / Glossary”** menu:

1. Enter term pairs in the format `Original=Translation` (one per line).
2. Example:
   ```text
   HarmonyOS=鸿蒙
   AI=人工智能
   ```
3. These terms are automatically appended to the system prompt, instructing the LLM to strictly follow your terminology.


## Usage

1. Launch **Voot** on your HarmonyOS device.
2. In the **配置 API** tab:

   * Pick an API provider.
   * Configure API URL + Key.
   * Set your target language.
3. Go to the **翻译 / Translate** tab:

   * Tap **“开启麦克风”** to start capturing audio.
   * Speak in the source language.
4. The UI will show:

   * **原始文本** (recognized source text)
   * **翻译文本** (translated result)

Use it as a live interpreter in meetings, lectures, or travel scenarios.


## Security & Privacy

Short summary (see in-app privacy policy / `PRIVACY.html` for details):

* Audio:

  * Recorded only on device for the current translation session.
  * Not uploaded to our servers (we have none).
  * Discarded after processing.
* API Keys:

  * Stored in the app sandbox.
  * Protected with HarmonyOS face/biometric mechanisms.
  * Never transmitted to any server except the provider you configured.
* Data Flow:

  * Text is sent only to your chosen provider (OpenAI / DeepL / etc.).
  * No central logging, analytics, or telemetry from the developer.


## Roadmap

Finished / planned / possible steps:

* Subtitle (Realized ✅) 
* Live Window on HarmonyOS (Realized ✅) 
* Desktop Widgets (Realized ✅)
* Token usage analytics (Realized ✅)

* Enhanced ASR and cutoff logic
* More supported original languages

Feel free to open issues or PRs with feature requests.

## Blueprints

### 1. Audio-Direct Multimodal 
Moving beyond "Speech-to-Text-to-Translation" lossy pipelines:
*   **Direct Audio Input**
Sending VAD-filtered audio segments directly to multimodal models (e.g., GPT-4o Audio, Gemini 1.5 Pro).
*   **Nuance Capture**
Preserving tone, emotion (sarcasm, urgency), and speaker identity which are often lost in ASR.
*   **Feedback Loop**
Using the rich understanding from the multimodal engine to "feed back" into the frontend, correcting previous ASR errors or updating the context for the Fast Track.

### 2. Confidence Scoring & Visual Feedback
*   Implement a confidence scoring system that highlights translated text based on the model's certainty.
*   Low-confidence segments could be visually marked (e.g., colored or underlined), prompting users to review or wait for the Slow Track refinement.


## Contributing

Contributions are welcome!

1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a new branch for your feature/bugfix.
3. Make changes and add tests where appropriate.
4. Submit a pull request with a clear description and screenshots if UI-related.

Before submitting, please:

* Do not commit any real API keys or secrets.
* Ensure the app builds and runs on the current HarmonyOS SDK version.

## Model Performance

* Well performed LLM/Translating models on this APP by testing:

  * OpenAI: gpt-4o-mini (preferred👍), gpt-4o
  * DeepL: Free and Pro are both well performed (preferred👍)
  * 豆包（火山引擎）: DeepSeek v3.2 (deepseek-v3-2-251201) (preferred👍)

* Badly performed LLM/Translating models on this APP by testing:

  * OpenAI: gpt-5 and all thinking models series
  * 豆包（火山引擎）: Doubao-Seed-1.6-lite (doubao-seed-1-6-lite-251015)

## Known Issues

* ASR accuracy may vary based on background noise and microphone quality.
* Some API providers may have rate limits or usage costs; monitor your usage carefully.
* ~~When tap **传译** button in desktop widget, the app may not open interpretation correctly due to HarmonyOS restrictions.~~ [Fixed]
* ~~Subtitle floating window may have layout issues on certain screen sizes, e.g. Pad.~~ [Fixed]
  You can try to adjust the size of the floating window manually. An update may fix this in the future.
* Doubao API always gives latente responses when use Lite models. This may be due to the server side of Doubao, not the app itself. [To be confirmed]
